  <h2>About Me</h2></center>
  
<p>My names is Vadim Volovodovskiy. I am from Brooklyn, New York. Currently I am an owner of 3D 4D Ultrasound facility called <a href="http://1stglimpse.com">1st Glimpse Inc</a>. In the About Me section I will discuss my education, work experience, and coding experience.</p>
<p>I graduated from Wagner College with 3.34 GPA. Where I studied Business Administration concentration in Business Management.
</p>
<p>After I graduated from College, I became a Paralegal at an accounting firm called BDO Seidman, LLP. As a Paralegal my job was to review company 
documents using Concrodance and to tag relevant documents. My next position was at Viacom, where I worked as Corporate Paralegal. After spending almost a year at Viacom, I left to work
 at Morvillo, Abramowitz et al as a Lead Paralegal/Paralegal Manager. Looking for a new challenge, I decided to open my own business. With the help of my family, I opened 1st Glimpse Inc. a 3D 4D Ultrasound facility.
</p>
<p>Currently 1st Glimpse Inc is successful mostly due to the business website, which was created by a web design company. Although they were great at designing the website, they had no knoweledge of my product. Thus, I needed to learn HTML and CSS. Through trial and error and through research I acquired basic coding skills. 
</p>
<p>
Now that I have some knoweledge of HTML and CSS. I am ready for a new challenge and I hope to continue my education at General Assembly. </p>
